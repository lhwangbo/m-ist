Machine-learning derived mortality prediction model for patients with acute ischaemic stroke based on IST-1 dataset

Using seven base learner implementations of Scikit Learn, my colleagues and I have developed this stacking ensemble learning model to predict six-month mortality for ischaemic stroke patients. This work has not been peer-reviewed yet. And when the peer-review process is complete, I will change this README file accordingly.

We have used four libraries, Scikit Learn, XGBoost, and Pandas along with their dependencies

I will update this file as soon as the manuscript gets published.

Our team developed both base and ensemble ML models using Scikit-learn (version 1.0.1) and XGBoost (version 1.5.0) libraries on Python (version 3.9.7).
